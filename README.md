Protocol Design on a Global Network
===================================

As designers and implementers of protocols that will be implemented on
the global Internet, we have responsibilities to think about the
impact of our decisions and the way that the protocols are structured.

This repo is an attempt to put together a coherent understanding of
those impacts and responsibilities.

We'll write mostly in markdown for now, and hopefully put together a
collection of relevant links as well.
